# Contrast-Based Structural Dynamics (CBSD)

This repository contains the original theoretical development of **Contrast-Based Structural Dynamics (CBSD)**, a foundational physics framework introduced by **André Hampshire**.

CBSD reformulates space, time, motion, and mass as emergent properties of contrast fields resolved by an embedded observer. It replaces coordinate-based primitives with structural discernibility, allowing geometry and force to arise from perceptual modulation alone.
