# Contrast-Based Structural Dynamics (CBSD)

This repository contains the original theoretical development of **Contrast-Based Structural Dynamics (CBSD)**, a foundational physics framework introduced by **André Hampshire**.

CBSD reformulates space, time, motion, and mass as emergent properties of contrast fields resolved by an embedded observer. It replaces coordinate-based primitives with structural discernibility, allowing geometry and force to arise from perceptual modulation alone.

## 🔍 Key Contributions

- **Emergent metric geometry** from injectivity of contrast signature maps
- **Reconstruction of velocity and acceleration** via contrast gradients
- **Structural mass tensor** from responsiveness to modulation
- **Simulations** demonstrating classical behavior from contrast principles
- **New physical ontology** based on perceptual thresholds and discernibility
